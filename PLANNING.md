  - Enhanced project status tracking with customized status options

- **Analytic Accounts (account.analytic.account)**
  - Direct link to projects via wilco_project_id
  - Extended to track financial KPIs (receivables, payables, revenue, expenses)
  - Profit tracking (gross/net profit calculations)

- **Sales & Purchasing**
  - Custom invoice methods (invoice_by_line, invoice_by_order)
  - Budget cost tracking at line item level
  - Revision tracking with document numbering

- **Financial Integration**
  - Automatic analytic distribution from projects
  - Enhanced payment tracking with project allocation
  - Specialized financial reporting (aged analytics)

### Utility Modules
- **External Identifier Utility**
  - Manages consistent external identifiers across models
  - Prevents duplicates and enforces naming conventions

### Data Fixers
- **Sale Order Invoice Link Fixer**
  - Resolves missing links between invoices and sales orders
  - Maintenance utility for data consistency

## üîÑ Workflows

### Sales Process
1. Project creation with unique project number
2. Sales quotation/order linked to project
3. Budget cost tracking at line level
4. Invoice generation (by line or by order total)
5. Payment tracking with analytic distributions

### Purchase Process
1. Purchase linked to project
2. Auto-distribution of analytics
3. Revision tracking with document numbers
4. Invoice verification with project assignments

### Financial Reporting
1. Enhanced analytic reports by project

### Models
- Extend existing models where possible
- Document model relationships in method comments
