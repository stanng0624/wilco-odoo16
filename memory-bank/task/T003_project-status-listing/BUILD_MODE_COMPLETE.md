## 🔑 Key Implementation Details

### Why This Approach?
- **QWeb Template + Report Action**: Simple, standard Odoo pattern vs. wizard complexity
- **No New Model**: Reuses existing project, analytic, sales order, and invoice data
- **Financial Logic from T001**: Ensures consistency and reduces bugs
- **Landscape Layout**: Better for 20-column display
- **Pre-calculated Values**: Efficient template rendering

### Architecture Decisions
- Single report template (no multiple pages)
- Client-side table rendering (vs. server-side table generation)
- Financial calculations in template (vs. new computed fields)
- Standard Odoo menu structure (vs. custom navigation)

### Performance Considerations
- O(n) complexity where n = number of projects
- Suitable for SME portfolios (typical: 10-100 projects)
- Load time target: < 5 seconds
- No pagination implemented (can add later)
