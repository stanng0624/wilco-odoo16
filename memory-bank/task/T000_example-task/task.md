- **Created**: 2025-10-06
- **Updated**: 2025-10-06
- **Assignee**: Documentation Team
- **Complexity**: L2-Medium

## Description
This is an example task demonstrating the new task organization structure. It serves as a reference template for creating new tasks following the updated guidelines.

This task shows:
- How to structure a task.md file
- How to organize plans within the task folder
- How to link between task and plan documents
- How to track progress and completion

## Requirements
- [x] Create example task structure
- [x] Demonstrate plan breakdown
- [x] Show linking patterns
- [x] Provide clear documentation

## Dependencies
- **Blocks**: None (this is an example)
- **Blocked By**: None
- **Related**: 
  - [T003: Memory Bank Migration](../T003_memory-bank-migration/task.md) - Task organization migration

## Plan Documents
- [Main Implementation Plan](./plan.md) - High-level strategy and approach
- [Data Model Design](./plan-001_data-model.md) - Detailed database schema
- [UI/UX Design](./plan-002_ui-design.md) - Interface specifications

## Metadata
- **Category**: Documentation
- **Module**: memory-bank
- **Impact**: Low
- **Estimated Effort**: 2 hours

## Progress Log

### 2025-10-06 - Task Created
- Created example task structure
- Developed plan.md with implementation strategy
- Created detailed plan breakdowns for data model and UI
- Documented linking patterns and best practices

### 2025-10-06 - Completed
- All example files created
- Documentation finalized
- Ready for reference use

## Completion Criteria
- [x] Task folder created with proper naming (T000_example-task)
- [x] task.md created with all required sections
- [x] plan.md created showing high-level approach
- [x] Detailed plan breakdowns (plan-001, plan-002) created
- [x] All files properly linked together
- [x] Serves as clear example for future tasks

## Results/Deliverables
- ✅ Complete example task structure in `memory-bank/task/T000_example-task/`
- ✅ Demonstrates new organization pattern
- ✅ Provides templates for task creators
- ✅ Shows proper linking and cross-referencing

## Notes
This is a reference example only. Real tasks should:
- Use sequential IDs starting from T001
- Have meaningful descriptions and requirements
- Track actual progress and blockers
- Document real implementation results
