## Historical Tasks & Project Context

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed Tasks

#### Customer Invoice Summary System (June 2025)
- **Impact**: Comprehensive financial reporting system implemented
- **Features**:
  - Period-based reporting (monthly/yearly)
  - Opening period support for historical data consolidation
  - Multiple grouping options: by period, customer, project, or sales account
  - Invoice breakdown view showing individual invoice details
  - Running balance calculations (period_balance and total_sales_amount)
  - Down payment tracking and deduction reporting
  - Settlement tracking with payment dates
  - Quick access to related invoices, journal entries, and line items
  - Filtering by customer, project, and sales account
  - Customizable as-of-date for point-in-time reporting

#### Core Enhancements (April-May 2025)
- **Sale Order Invoice by Order Total**: Added ability to invoice entire order with single line
- **Project Reference Tracking**: Improved traceability of partner involvement in projects
- **Analytic Account Line Calculation**: Enhanced financial analysis with categorized amounts

### üîÑ Current Bug Fixes & Enhancements

#### Bug Fixes (Priority: High)
- [ ] **Sale Order Line Analytic Distribution Consistency**
  - Expected Impact: Ensure all sale order lines properly distribute analytics
  - Status: Identified, needs implementation

- [ ] **Invoice Deletion with Linked Sales Orders**  
  - Expected Impact: Prevent data integrity issues when invoices with sales order links are deleted
  - Status: Identified, needs implementation

#### Enhancements (Priority: Medium)
- [x] **Vendor Bill Summary Settled Logic Alignment** (COMPLETED - December 2024)
  - Impact Achieved: Vendor bill summary now follows customer invoice summary pattern for settled fields
  - Status: Implementation complete - All field references updated consistently + settled calculation logic fixed
  - Complexity: Level 2 (Simple Enhancement)
  - Files Modified: wilco_vendor_bill_summary.py, wilco_vendor_bill_summary_views.xml, wilco_vendor_bill_summary_wizard.py
  - Changes Made:
    - Renamed `paid_amount` field to `settled_amount` in model and all references
    - Renamed `paid_dates` field to `settled_dates` in model and all references
    - Updated help text and labels from "Paid" to "Settled" throughout
    - Updated balance calculation help text to reflect new terminology
    - Renamed `_compute_paid_amount` method to `_compute_settled_amount` in wizard
    - Updated all view references in tree, form, and search views
    - **FIXED: Settled amount calculation logic** - Now checks both matched_credit_ids and matched_debit_ids, uses max_date instead of create_date, includes currency conversion
    - Verified syntax validity and XML structure
  - Result: Consistent settled logic pattern across both customer invoice and vendor bill summary systems with accurate settlement calculations

- [ ] **Project Analytic Reporting Performance**
  - Expected Impact: Speed up analytic reports for projects with many transactions
  - Related Discovery: Performance issue in _wilco_compute_amounts method
  - Status: Performance analysis needed

- [ ] **Bulk Project Assignment to Invoices**
  - Expected Impact: Allow users to update multiple invoices with project information
  - Status: Enhancement requested

- [ ] **Customer Invoice Summary Enhancement**
  - Expected Impact: Improve financial reporting with opening periods and date filtering
  - Status: Building on existing success

### üéØ Planned Future Features

#### Major Features (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] **Project Profitability Dashboard**
  - Expected Impact: Visual representation of project financial performance
  - Dependencies: Enhanced analytic computation
  - Timeline: Q1 2025

- [ ] **Project Budget vs Actual Comparison Report**
  - Expected Impact: Provide variance analysis for project managers
  - Dependencies: Budget cost tracking
  - Timeline: Q1 2025

#### Workflow Enhancements (Priority: Low)
- [ ] **Document Approval Workflow**
  - Expected Impact: Add formal approval steps to project documents
  - Timeline: Q2 2025

- [ ] **Project Timeline Visualization**
  - Expected Impact: Visual representation of project milestones and progress
  - Timeline: Q2 2025

### üîç Discovered Issues & Patterns

#### Technical Debt
- **Wilco Project ID Propagation**: Need consistent behavior for wilco_project_id propagation across related documents
- **Performance Optimization**: _wilco_compute_amounts method becomes slow with large number of analytic lines

#### System Patterns Identified
- **Analytic Distribution**: Automatic project assignment from sales/purchase orders
- **Financial KPI Computation**: Real-time calculation of project metrics
- **Data Consistency**: Utility modules ensure referential integrity
