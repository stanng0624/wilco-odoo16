# MEMORY BANK MIGRATION PLAN

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Consolidate PLANNING.md and TASK.md into Memory Bank structure to eliminate duplication and establish single source of truth.

## ðŸ“Š Content Analysis & Mapping

### PLANNING.md â†’ Memory Bank Files
| PLANNING.md Content | Target Memory Bank File | Action |
|---------------------|------------------------|---------|
| Architecture & Core Models | systemPatterns.md | MERGE |
| Workflows (Sales/Purchase) | productContext.md | MERGE |
| Naming Conventions | systemPatterns.md | MERGE |
| Development Guidelines | systemPatterns.md | MERGE |
| Data Structures | techContext.md | MERGE |

### TASK.md â†’ Memory Bank Files  
| TASK.md Content | Target Memory Bank File | Action |
|-----------------|------------------------|---------|
| Current Tasks | tasks.md | MERGE (replace current focus) |
| Completed Tasks | tasks.md | APPEND |
| Discovered Issues | tasks.md | INTEGRATE |
| Planned Tasks | tasks.md | INTEGRATE |

## ðŸ”„ Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Content Consolidation
1. **Backup Current Memory Bank** (safety)
2. **Extract Reusable Patterns** from PLANNING.md
3. **Consolidate Task History** from TASK.md
4. **Identify Conflicting Information** between sources

### Phase 2: Memory Bank Enhancement
1. **Expand systemPatterns.md** with architecture details
2. **Enhance productContext.md** with business workflows
3. **Enrich techContext.md** with data structures
4. **Restructure tasks.md** with comprehensive task history

### Phase 3: Validation & Cleanup
1. **Verify Information Consistency** across memory bank
2. **Remove Duplicate PLANNING.md and TASK.md** files
3. **Update .gitignore** to exclude legacy files
4. **Test Memory Bank Completeness**

## ðŸ“‹ Specific Migration Actions

### systemPatterns.md Enhancements
- [ ] Add Wilco-specific naming conventions (wilco_ prefix rules)
- [ ] Document core model extensions (project.project, account.analytic.account)
- [ ] Include development guidelines and best practices
- [ ] Add utility module patterns (External Identifier Utility)

### productContext.md Enhancements  
- [ ] Add sales process workflows (quotation â†’ invoice â†’ payment)
- [ ] Document purchase process workflows
- [ ] Include financial reporting processes
- [ ] Add project management workflows

### techContext.md Enhancements
- [ ] Document data structure relationships
- [ ] Add financial integration patterns
- [ ] Include analytic distribution mechanisms
- [ ] Document security considerations

### tasks.md Restructuring
- [ ] Preserve current vendor bill summary focus as primary
- [ ] Add historical task section with completed work
- [ ] Integrate discovered issues into challenges section
- [ ] Add planned tasks to future phases

## ðŸ”’ Risk Mitigation
- **Data Loss Prevention**: Backup before migration
- **Version Control**: Commit changes incrementally
- **Rollback Plan**: Keep original files until validation complete
- **Documentation**: Document migration decisions and rationale

## âœ… Success Criteria
- [ ] All PLANNING.md content integrated into Memory Bank
- [ ] All TASK.md content consolidated into tasks.md
- [ ] No information loss during migration
- [ ] Memory Bank serves as complete single source of truth
- [ ] Legacy files safely removed
- [ ] Team can reference unified documentation

## ðŸ“… Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 30 minutes (content analysis and backup)
- **Phase 2**: 45 minutes (memory bank enhancement)
- **Phase 3**: 15 minutes (validation and cleanup)
- **Total**: ~90 minutes

## ðŸŽ¯ Post-Migration Benefits
- **Single Source of Truth**: All project documentation in Memory Bank
- **Consistency**: Unified structure across all documentation
- **Maintainability**: Single location for updates
- **Integration**: Better integration with development workflow
- **Scalability**: Memory Bank system designed for growth
